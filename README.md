# Geo Mapping Earthquakes and Plates

This project looks at the occurance of earthquakes and plots their location accordingly. Additionally, the user has the option to change the style and graph appearing on the map. 

### Running on GitHub Pages

You might note that sometimes a 403 error occurs when making a call to the MapBox API. However, the map still loads. Moreover, I changed some setting on the API Token and it seems the issue is solved, and the map should load for all users.
